# Twinklr CAD files

CAD files for components of Twinklr, including the main enclosure.

## Contents

* `raspi-stand` - two DXF files for left/right legs to attach to the Raspberry Pi touchscreen stand, as [available from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display-with-frame)
* `crankstand` - simple small wooden stand to mount a rotary encoder, for use as a desktop demo.
* `enclosure` - the main enclosure. This includes Illustrator 3 and SVG files for the two main things to be cut: a single 3mm sheet of Acrylic, and the cheeks to be cut from 6mm laserply. It also includes an IGES file for the whole enclosure, exported from Autodesk Fusion 360.
